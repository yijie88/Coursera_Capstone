            "source": "Vancouver is one of the largestest cities in Canada. It is home to approximately two million residents as of 2020. I had the chance to visit Vancouver in 2018 and was amazed at how different it was from my home city in Mississauga, Ontario. I thought if i were to move to Vancouver for work, where are some possible locations that would suit my/ or someone else' needs. Therefore i decided to use this opportunity to research venues around different neighborhoods and distance to public transportation, price and demographic by location. \nThe housing situation in Vancouver has gotten out of control in recent years due to outside investments and the government has been trying to control it through its policies. Therefore, it is difficult to find more reasonably priced housing and thus i decided to work on this project to find the most optimum locations to live in based on the needs of individuals such as myself.\nWith the problem outlined, i can create a map of venues from different neighborhoods, demographics, price and compare against each other to see if we can find any correlation between the metrics i mentioned and to find the ideal location to live."
